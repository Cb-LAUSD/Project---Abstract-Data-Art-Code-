# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type.

Example:

Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ESDqWyj_jofQhOmmqe3X_jK4puPeLGm85FdTXnquiLQ/edit?usp=sharing

- **Names** (String) - name of the dog breed
- **Breed Group** (String) - breeding group of dog 
- **Bred For** (String) - reasons for breeding
- **Minimum Life Span** (int) - minimum life span of dog breed
- **Maximum Life Span** (int) - maximum life span of dog breed
- **Minimum Height**  (int) - minimum height of dog breed 
- **Maximum Height**  (int) - maximum height of dog breed
- **Temperment** (String) - the normal temperment of dog breed 
## UML Diagram

Put and image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get display on this README.

## Video Demo

Record a short video of your abstract art animation to display here on your README. You can do this by:

- Screen record your project running on Code.org.
- Upload that recording to YouTube.
- Take a thumbnail for your image.
- Upload the thumbnail image to your repo.
- Use the following markdown

## Description

Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.

Our user story is about a animal shelter worker that is sorting through dog types to allow a potential owner to see the type of dog they are looking for. To do this they will shift through a list of dog breeds and information about each one. This is done through the math random command to allow owners to see all different types of dogs and their information. When run it will return the toStrings for each attribute of the dog. This will also sort through the minimum size of the dog in order to give an example of the size of dog compared to others. Finally, based on this size it will also change the bark and the style of font that is used.
